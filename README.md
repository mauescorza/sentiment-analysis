# Sentiment Analysis Project

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique used to identify and extract subjective information from text. The growth of social media has increased interest in sentiment analysis, as virtual opinions have become valuable for businesses. Companies utilize sentiment analysis to market products, discover opportunities, and manage their reputation by analyzing reviews, ratings, and expressions.

### Hypothesis
It is possible to automatically determine the sentiment associated with a message on social media through text analysis.

### Objective
To compare the performance of different classifiers in categorizing tweets into sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, and surprise.

## Implementation Details

### Data
The project uses labeled datasets for training, testing, and validation. These datasets include tweets categorized into different sentiments.

### Libraries and Tools
The project utilizes the following Python libraries and tools:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (for machine learning algorithms)
- Google Colab (for code execution and data manipulation)

## Clasification

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)
The SVM algorithm is employed to classify tweets. The accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrices for both the test and validation sets are presented.

### Naive Bayes
A Naive Bayes classifier is implemented using the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. The accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix are provided for evaluation.

### Random Forest
The Random Forest algorithm is used to classify tweets, and its accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix are presented.

### Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is employed as a classification algorithm, and its accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix for the test set are provided.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the application of different machine learning algorithms for sentiment analysis. The evaluation metrics help assess the performance of each algorithm in classifying tweets into various emotions. Further improvements and fine-tuning can be explored for enhancing model accuracy and robustness.
